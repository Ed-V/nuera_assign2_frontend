Nura Insurance Assessment 2 Frontend

To start a server use: npm run start

To build the project use: npm run build

-----

At the start of the project please use npm install to download all dependencies 

You will need to configure the baseURL for your local API server in wrappers/axiosWrapper.js

--------

The add and remove button are self explanatory.

The update button functions a bit differently. To use the update button fill in the information you want to use to update and click update on the item you want it applied it.

--------

Refreshing the page will call the api, as will add item, remove item, and delete item.
