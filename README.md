Nura Insurance Assessment 2 Frontend

To start a server use: npm run start

To build the project use: npm run build

-----

At the start of the project please use npm install to download all dependencies 

You will need to configure the baseURL for your local API server in wrappers/axiosWrapper.js

--------

The add and remove button are self explanatory.

The update button functions a bit differently. To use the update button fill in the information you want to use to update and click update on the item you want it applied it.

--------

Refreshing the page will call the api, as will add item, remove item, and delete item. 

-------

Attempted to use the front end provided by Neura but ran into a few bugs:

-After a fresh install runs into a "rest parameter must be of an array type" must upgrade typescript to fix

-Delete buttons cause the front end to crash

Due to time constraints I have used my current working frontend to demonstrate the backend.
